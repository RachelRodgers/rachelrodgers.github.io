title: Rachel â€“ Bioinformaticist
---

# Hi, I'm Rachel
Bioinformaticist since 2017. I build robust, researcher-friendly tools that turn complex biological data into clear, reproducible insights.

## About Me
Since 2017, Iâ€™ve helped researchers manage and interpret complex biological data, from microbiome (16S) and RNA-seq to CRISPR and viral sequencing. I specialize in building reproducible computational pipelines and interactive analysis tools that bring next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to life.

My primary language is R, and I frequently develop Shiny applications, interactive R Markdown reports, and object-oriented tools using S4. I also work extensively with Bash scripting and high-performance computing environments, managing Linux servers and RShiny deployments for multi-user teams.

My workflow is grounded in transparency and reproducibility. I use Git and Snakemake to create well-documented, version-controlled pipelines that are easy to share, audit, and maintain. I'm especially motivated by the challenge of making complex analyses more accessible to researchers through intuitive design.

## Projects

Here are a few highlights of my work and experiments:

- **[Microbiome Shiny App](#)** â€“ A user-friendly tool for exploring 16S amplicon data, including taxonomy filtering and diversity plots.
- **[RNA-seq Pipeline](#)** â€“ A modular Snakemake pipeline with built-in QC, differential expression, and interactive reporting via R Markdown.
- **[CRISPR Screen Explorer](#)** â€“ Interactive R Shiny dashboard for visualizing sgRNA distributions and hit calling results.
