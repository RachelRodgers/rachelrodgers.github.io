# Fundamentals of Drawing and Perspective

## Week 7: Three-Value Statement

<u>Blocking in the Placement of Objects in the Still Life</u>

* Moving onto a grouped still life (four objects in the instructor's example)
* Three value block-in (rough-in, not much detail):
  * Begin with envelope shape to start the composition
  * Use direct angle transfer, plumb lines to set the relationships between objects, etc
  * Check the negative shapes between objects
* After blocking in the general shape, can make drawing more specific, but eventually want to git rid of the contour lines
  * Simplify objects into geometric shapes, then "carve" from those
* Continue checking the horizontals and verticals to prevent the objects from looking crooked
* Draw out transparencies (helps you better understand what you're seeing than just looking at outer contour)

<u>Refining the Contours of the Still Life</u>

* Use the shoulder and arm for sweeping, broader strokes to help keep lines consistent (ex: tall verticals)
* When drawing multiple objects, make sure the perspective between objects is consistent
  * Same with ellipses (it's easy to spot inconsistencies in perspective)

<u>Mapping Out the Shadow Shapes</u>

* Start adding in cash shadows (on forms and background)
* Previously, two-tone value block-in (mid & dark gray)
* Currently, hree-value block-in (adds dark gray)
* Incorporate background drapery
